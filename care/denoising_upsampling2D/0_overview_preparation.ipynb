    "In this Tutorial we demonstrate how to use [CARE](http://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/) for a simple 2D denoising task, where corresponding pairs of low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) images of cells are available. \n",
    "The high SNR images are acquistions of Human U2OS cells taken from the [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC006/) and the low SNR images were created by synthetically adding *strong read-out and shot-noise* and applying *pixel binning* of 2x2, thus mimicking acquisitions at a very low light level.   \n",

    "![](imgs/denoising_binning_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image pair should be registered, which in a real application setting is best achieved by acquiring both stacks _interleaved_, i.e. as different channels that correspond to the different exposure/laser settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the image pairs were synthetically created in this example, they are already aligned perfectly."
